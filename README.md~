Conway-s-Game-Of-Life

An organic growth simulator written in java where plants can be placed with a left click, and organisms can be placed with a ctrl-left click. Organisms eat plants, but die if they don't eat for a certain number of simulation steps. If an organism eats enough, it will reproduce. Plants reproduce whenever there is space next to them.  

To run: 
1.make sure you have Jave <- jre or jdk work fine. just google them
2.doubleclick the .jar file
3. (optional)if you are running linux you might have to allow the file to execute

Importing into IDE: 
make a new project on eclipse or netbeans, and select import->general->filesystem, 
and select all the files from the scr directory. Then build the project (hit the play button). Have fun!
